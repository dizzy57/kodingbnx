This is a simple web-app that may be used by any group of people to organize and run their daily study/practice routine. 

It serves two main purposes: task management/scheduling and solutions submission. 

## Solution submission

Every user has access to a submissions page where they can publish their solution for the current day's problem in a form of a URL (typically a URL to a third party publishing service like Pastebin).

## Task management and scheduling

An admin can prepare a list of tasks for students. One task per day :)
